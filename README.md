# Getting Your TODO List!

This project was used both bootstrap and material-UI,
It contains a TODO list which can be created only by a user, but viewed by all.
for now the realtions of users/lists are many to one, typically it should be a list per user(or many to many depends on the demand).

- you can perform CRUD operations on Users and Tasks.
- added guards and interceptors in Angular for jwt auth.
- used both session storage and cookies to perform a highly secure auth(for example as well)
- the app lacks graphics, i can draw a proper 1 line man though.
